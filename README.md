# UFOs
## Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time including city, state, country and shape.

#### Resources Used: 
- Sources: ufo_starterCode.js and index.html
- Tools: JavaScript, Jupyter Notebook, VSCode, HTML/CSS

## How to use the new webpage:
#### Step 1: 
Visit the webpage:

#### Step 2:
Scroll down to the filter search:

#### Step 3:
Put in the criteria that you would like to filter by
Ex: Setting the filter to Jan 13, 2010 would look and give you these results:

## Future Updates to Project:
#### Current drawback to design:
The filter search is case sensitive, which may be frustrating to some users. All of the data that is being used in the filtered search is lowercase. If a user puts in "CA" for California instead of "ca" they will not get any results.

#### Recommendations for further development:
1. Edit the code so that the filter search is not case sensitive.
2. Allow for a user to look for a range of dates instead of one specific date.
